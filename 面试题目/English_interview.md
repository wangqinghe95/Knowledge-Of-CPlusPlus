After graduating in June 2018,I worked in Shenhao Technology Corporation, ltd. in Hangzhou using C++ to do robot related work, and left hangzhou in March 2020.

In July 2020, I came to Beijing to start my current job in QiLin Software Corporation, in which my primary work is to develop domestic office software products and my colleagues are about 6 people.

In March this year, our department, Intelligent Application division, decided to develop a new product, and I was assigned to do the WEB development by VUE. Within a period of six months, I has helped them to build version 1.0 successfully, and want to search for job about C++ now.
