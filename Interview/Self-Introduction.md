## Reasons for resignation

### The reason why I leave from my first job.
1. My first job was paid so little that I have no saving other than renting or eating. I need to switch to a higher job to make my life more secure.
2. For the first 20 years of my life, I rarely had opportunity to visit other places, except my hometown and the city where I studied, so I chose to go to Beijing at my age of 24, since I have enough passion to expore new things. So I come to Beijing to see something I ever seen before

### The reason why I leave from my second job.
1. The department changed a new business, a project to store documents online, and asked me to do work related to Web development, which I am not interested in, so after helping them to complete the first version, I chose to leave.
2. I chose to go to Beijing just to broad my horizons, to go to a distant city to meet some new friends, to visit the captial to see the north of the motherland. Now after a year and a half of living in Beijing, my goal had been achieved, and I think the life in beijing and my personality are not match, it is too busy and there is no possibility for me to settle down in Beijing, Simply I left Beijing, to live more suitable for Suzhou.
3. I am a person who likes to sparate work and life. I work hard at work time and enjoy life after work, going swimming, cycling, reading books, and going to concerts. But in Beijing, there is no life, you will work at work time, and after work, you will only want to lie in bed to play mobile phone, and don't desire to do anything else. I am not only one who has this feeling, but also my other friends in Beijing. Moreover, the friends I have known in Beijing have left there in recent years and gone to various places that they like. But until now, I still think that Beijing is still worth living for a period of time, when people was young.

### the reason why do you want to change work this time?
